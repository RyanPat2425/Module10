                    <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Patterson. I am a North Carolina-based designer with a strong focus on logo design, digital/print design, and brand design. Design has always played a huge part in my life, starting with illustration as a child. This would eventually lead me to my love for advertising and set me on my journey as a graphic designer.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        My mission as a designer is to provide the highest quality designs that meet both the client’s and my own high expectations. I promise each client that I will deliver the most effective design for their needs and a design that reflects their company’s message. The state of graphic design is ever changing and evolving, and so must the designers in this field. This is something that I find both a welcomed challenge and a rewarding aspect that constantly drives me to grow and evolve myself.

                            <h2>Logo Design</h2>
                            <p>Logos have the potential to steer any project in the right direction and in most cases can be the difference between a successful campaign and a less impactful branding experience. The effectivesness of a logo hinges on the designers ability to capture the tone and voice of the client into the design. Logo design has always been a focal point of my design journey and I find this area of the branding process to be the most exciting and rewarding. </p>

                            <h2>Print Design</h2>
                            <p>The only thing that separates print designs and digital designs are the color modes. Knowing how to properly utilize this principle is just a small part of creating designs for print and web usage. What works for print may not have the same effect on your website or social accounts and vice versa. Print designs can include posters/flyers, business cards, stationary materials, invitations, advertisements, and package designs. Digital or web designs share some of the same materials as print with the addition of social media designs, email, and character designs. All of these areas are within my abilities to create for you and will do so with as much care and attention I would with any other project. </p>

                            <h2>Brand Design</h2>
                            <p>Branding design requires a wide range of skills, not just in graphic design. Time management and communication skills are paramount to a branding campaign’s success. Branding projects can be small in size with little materials needed, while others can be extensive with numerous designs needed. From logo designs to complete social media overhauls, branding campaigns take the client’s dreams and goals for their business and puts it into visual form. </p>
